# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The application uses **Streamlit** with a comprehensive multi-page workspace design:
- **Navigation System**: Tabbed interface with 8 specialized workspaces
- **Chat Analysis**: Enhanced conversational interface with smart suggestions and visualization integration
- **File Manager**: Multi-file upload, comparison, and merging capabilities
- **Data Profiling Dashboard**: Comprehensive data quality assessment and insights
- **Smart Visualizations**: AI-suggested charts with interactive creation tools
- **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling
- **Export & Reports**: PDF generation, code export, and sharing capabilities
- **Collaboration Hub**: Session sharing, comments, and team analysis features
- **AI Insights**: Automated pattern detection and intelligent recommendations

## Backend Architecture
The platform follows a **modular microservices-inspired architecture** with specialized components:
- **AnalystAgent**: Core AI conversation and analysis engine using LangChain CSV Agent
- **VisualizationEngine**: Intelligent chart generation and data visualization recommendations
- **DataProfiler**: Comprehensive data quality assessment and statistical profiling
- **MultiFileManager**: Advanced file handling, comparison, and merging capabilities
- **ExportManager**: Report generation, code export, and sharing functionality
- **AdvancedAnalytics**: Machine learning, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling
- **CollaborationManager**: Team features, session sharing, and comment systems
- **AIInsights**: Automated pattern detection and intelligent recommendation engine
- **Configuration Module**: Environment management and API key validation

## Data Processing Pattern
The application follows a **temporary file storage** pattern where uploaded CSV files are saved to a local temporary directory to enable the LangChain agent to access and analyze the data. This approach allows the AI agent to work with pandas DataFrames and execute Python code for data analysis.

## AI Integration Architecture
The system uses a **chain-of-thought approach** with LangChain's experimental CSV agent:
- **GPT-4o model**: Configured with temperature=0 for deterministic, analytical responses
- **CSV Agent**: Automatically generates and executes Python code to answer user queries
- **Dangerous code execution**: Explicitly enabled to allow the agent to run pandas operations on the data

## Error Handling Strategy
The application implements **graceful degradation** with comprehensive error handling:
- API key validation at startup
- File existence verification before analysis
- User-friendly error messages for configuration issues
- Robust exception handling throughout the processing pipeline

# External Dependencies

# Delta Plan vs Current Specifications

## Key Changes from Initial Analysis

### 1. **API Contracts Enhancement**
- **Added**: OpenAPI 3.0 YAML specification with complete schema definitions
- **Enhanced**: Detailed error codes (400, 404, 413, 422, 429) with specific scenarios
- **Improved**: Request/response validation with proper data types and constraints

### 2. **Schema Builder Specification**
- **Refined**: PII detection confidence scoring (0-1 scale)
- **Added**: Performance benchmarks (30s profiling, 1GB memory limit)
- **Enhanced**: Relationship mapping for future join capabilities
- **Improved**: Synonym mapping with confidence thresholds

### 3. **NLâ†’SQL Engine Specification**
- **Clarified**: LLM model selection criteria (GPT-4/Claude-3.5 reliability focus)
- **Added**: Few-shot prompt engineering approach
- **Enhanced**: Confidence thresholds for human review (<80%)
- **Improved**: Query complexity scoring methodology

### 4. **Test Plan Expansion**
- **Added**: Phase-based execution plan (4 phases over 4 days)
- **Enhanced**: Synthetic data generation strategy with Faker library
- **Improved**: Performance metrics with specific targets (p95 < 5s, <1GB memory)
- **Added**: Edge case testing (empty datasets, encoding issues)

### 5. **Risk Log Refinement**
- **Prioritized**: Risk severity with impact/probability matrix
- **Added**: Escalation procedures with specific response times
- **Enhanced**: Continuous monitoring requirements
- **Improved**: Risk review schedule (weekly/monthly/quarterly)

### 6. **Implementation Checklist**
- **Restructured**: 6-phase approach with clear dependencies
- **Added**: Success criteria with measurable metrics
- **Enhanced**: Risk mitigation tasks integrated into phases
- **Improved**: User acceptance criteria for pilot readiness

## Recommendations for Implementation

### Immediate Actions
1. **Start with API contracts** - Use OpenAPI spec for code generation
2. **Prioritize PII detection** - Critical for pilot user trust
3. **Implement confidence scoring** - Essential for query quality control
4. **Set up monitoring early** - Performance tracking from day 1

### Future Considerations
1. **Relationship mapping** - Foundation for multi-table queries
2. **Chart generation** - User experience differentiator
3. **Export governance** - Charlie integration for compliance
4. **Performance optimization** - Streaming for large files

## No Breaking Changes
All specifications maintain backward compatibility with existing system architecture and governance principles. Changes are enhancements rather than fundamental shifts.

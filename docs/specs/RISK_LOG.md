# The Analyst - Risk Log & Mitigations

## High Priority Risks

### R001: NLâ†’SQL Accuracy Degradation
**Risk**: LLM generates incorrect SQL, leading to wrong business insights
**Impact**: High - Data-driven decisions based on incorrect analysis
**Probability**: Medium - Complex queries, ambiguous natural language
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive test suite (100 canonical queries)
- Confidence scoring with human review for <80% confidence
- Query complexity limits to prevent edge cases
- Woodpecker validation for schema consistency and result sanity checks

### R002: PII Data Leakage
**Risk**: Personal information exposed through queries or exports
**Impact**: Critical - Regulatory violations, privacy breaches
**Probability**: Low - But high consequence
**Mitigation**:
- Multi-layer PII detection (name patterns, regex, sample data analysis)
- Column-level deny lists with automatic blocking
- Charlie governance for all exports
- Regular PII detection accuracy audits

### R003: Performance Degradation on Large Files
**Risk**: System becomes unusable with datasets >1M rows
**Impact**: High - Poor user experience, system unusability
**Probability**: Medium - Memory/CPU constraints
**Mitigation**:
- Streaming CSV processing for large files
- Query result pagination (LIMIT 1000 enforced)
- Background profiling with progress indicators
- Performance monitoring and auto-scaling

## Medium Priority Risks

### R004: Schema Profiling False Positives/Negatives
**Risk**: Incorrect data type detection affects query generation
**Impact**: Medium - Query failures, user frustration
**Probability**: Medium - Messy real-world data
**Mitigation**:
- Human-in-the-loop schema confirmation
- Multiple detection algorithms (statistical, ML, pattern-based)
- Schema override capabilities for edge cases
- Extensive test coverage with real-world data samples

### R005: SQL Injection via Natural Language
**Risk**: Malicious users craft queries to bypass security
**Impact**: Medium - Data exposure, system compromise
**Probability**: Low - sqlglot parsing provides protection
**Mitigation**:
- sqlglot AST parsing and reconstruction
- Whitelist of allowed operations only
- Input sanitization in Interceptor
- Regular security testing and penetration testing

### R006: Audit Trail Gaps
**Risk**: Incomplete logging affects compliance and debugging
**Impact**: Medium - Compliance violations, debugging difficulties
**Probability**: Low - Well-defined audit points
**Mitigation**:
- Structured logging at every pipeline stage
- Immutable audit records with cryptographic hashing
- Regular audit log validation and testing
- Automated compliance reporting

## Low Priority Risks

### R007: Chart Generation Misleading Visualizations
**Risk**: Inappropriate chart types create wrong impressions
**Impact**: Low - User confusion, but data remains correct
**Probability**: Medium - Chart selection heuristics
**Mitigation**:
- Conservative chart suggestions (bar, line, scatter only)
- User override capabilities
- Chart type validation based on data characteristics
- User education and best practices documentation

### R008: Rate Limiting False Positives
**Risk**: Legitimate users blocked by overly aggressive rate limiting
**Impact**: Low - User frustration, reduced adoption
**Probability**: Low - Configurable limits
**Mitigation**:
- Per-user rate limiting with burst allowances
- Tiered limits based on user roles
- Graceful degradation (cached results)
- User feedback mechanism for limit adjustments

### R009: Integration Failures with Corral Components
**Risk**: Interceptor/Woodpecker/Charlie integration issues
**Impact**: Medium - Reduced security, governance gaps
**Probability**: Low - Well-defined interfaces
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive integration testing
- Circuit breakers for external component failures
- Fallback modes with reduced functionality
- Regular integration health checks

## Risk Monitoring & Response

### Continuous Monitoring
- Real-time accuracy metrics dashboard
- Performance monitoring (response times, memory usage)
- Security event logging and alerting
- User feedback collection and analysis

### Escalation Procedures
- **Critical Issues**: Immediate escalation to CTO, 24/7 response
- **High Issues**: 4-hour response time, daily status updates
- **Medium Issues**: 24-hour response time, weekly review
- **Low Issues**: Next sprint planning cycle

### Risk Review Schedule
- **Weekly**: High priority risk status review
- **Monthly**: Full risk assessment update
- **Quarterly**: Risk tolerance and mitigation strategy review
